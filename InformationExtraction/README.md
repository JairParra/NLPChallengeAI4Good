# Information Extraction Task

The following are the proposed ideal tasks to accomplish: 

- Number of impacted members (absolute or a percentage) + trend words
  - Here we want to identify trend words, ie keywords that we want to identify along the numbers.  
  - We also want to identify the relevance of the information (say 0-5)
- Dynamic of the program (growth, development, reduction, decline, reduction, expansion, progress, improvement, update, change)
- Sentiment (positive, negative)

NOTE: We will work on the column RESULTATS_2018
