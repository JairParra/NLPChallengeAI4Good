# Information Extraction Task

The following are the proposed ideal tasks to accomplish: 

- Number of impacted members (absolute or a percentage)
  - Here we want to identify trend words, ie keywords that we want to identify along the numbers.  
- Dynamic of the program (growth, development, reduction, decline, reduction, expansion, progress, improvement, update, change)
- Sentiment (positive, negative)
